# Unit 2 Lesson 2 Problem Set
## Variables and Control Flow

### Directions
There are two parts to this problem set:
* A written response section
* JavaScript small problems

To complete and submit this problem set, you will...
1. Fork this lab
2. Navigate to the `first-last`directory 
3. Change the name of this directory to _your_ first and last
4. Your written response questions live in the `short-response.md` file. Record your answers to these questions, styled appropriately with markdown.
5. Your small problems are in `exercises` directory. The directory contains two files:
  * `README.md`
  * `answers.js` 
  The problem prompts are in `README.md`. You are to write your solutions in the `answers.js` file. Each question has a corresponding function body. You are to code your solutions inside of the function body. You will see a comment saying `// code goes below`. Write your solutions below each line. To test your solutions, run `node answers.js` from the `exercises` directory.
