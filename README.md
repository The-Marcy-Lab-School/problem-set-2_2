# Unit 2 Lesson 2 Problem Set
## Variables and Control Flow

### Directions
There are two parts to this problem set:
* A written response section
* JavaScript small problems

To complete and submit this problem set:
1. Your written response questions live in the `short-response.md` file. Record your answers to these questions in this file, but **do not** remove the original questions. Remember to style your responses appropriately with markdown.
2. Your small problems are in `exercises` directory. The directory contains two files:
  * `problems.md`
  * `answers.js`
  The problem prompts are in `problems.md`. You are to write your solutions in the `answers.js` file. Each question has a corresponding function body. You are to code your solutions inside of the function body. You will see a comment saying `// code goes below`. Write your solutions below each line. To test your solutions, run `node answers.js` from *inside* the `exercises` directory.
3. Commit frequently.
4. When you are finished, push your changes to your remote `master` branch.
